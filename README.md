# 2D-VHDL-Game-Up_Up_Go
The aim of this project was to create a game called Up Up Go with an FPGA board (BASYS3) and HC-SR04 sensors. This game has single-player and multi-player modes, and the  aim of it will be to avoid hitting any obstacles while constantly moving upwards direction. Also,  this game consists of a reward system that gives special powers for a limited amount of time. If the  player collects 3 rewards, for nearly 10 seconds the game will not be over even if the player hits  the obstacles. In addition, the character of the game can be moved with distant measurement sensors (HC-SR04). Moreover, the speed of the character will increase as time passes (nearly after 40  seconds character becomes faster), and the obstacles and the rewards will be randomly generated,  and the score will be displayed at the 7-segment display of BASYS3. Also, the amount of the reward  collected by the player will be demonstrated in LEDs on the BASYS3 in binary formation.
